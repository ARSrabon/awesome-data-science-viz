## Machine Learning

* [Dive into machine learning](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning) collections of links and notebooks for a gentle introduction to machine learning

### Libraries

* [Theano][] is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently
* [TensorFlow][] library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them.
* [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras) Deep Learning library for [Theano][] and [TensorFlow][]
* [Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit) is a machine learning system which pushes the frontier of machine learning with techniques such as online, hashing, allreduce, reductions, learning2search, active, and interactive learning. Writtent in C++ with bindings for python and other languages.

### Examples

* [AIMA python](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python) Python code for the book [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Artificial-Intelligence-Approach-Stuart-Russell/dp/1292153962)
* [TensorFlow Examples](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples) a [TensorFlow][] tutorial with popular machine learning algorithms implementation

## Text

### Analysis

* [fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText) a C++ library for sentence classification
* [simhash](https://github.com/leonsim/simhash) a python implementation of [Simhash Algorithm](http://www.wwwconference.org/www2007/papers/paper215.pdf) for detecting near-duplicate web documents

### Tools

* [inflect.py](https://github.com/pwdyson/inflect.py) Correctly generate plurals, ordinals, indefinite articles; convert numbers to words

## Images

* [tesseract-ocr][] well tested [OCR][] engine written in C++
* [match](https://github.com/usepavlov/match) makes it easy to search for images that look similar to each other

## Data

* [Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) a collective list of public JSON APIs for use in web development
* [7 and a quarter hours of largely highway driving](https://github.com/commaai/research) from [comma.ai research](http://comma.ai/)
